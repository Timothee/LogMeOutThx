LogMeOutThx
===========

LogMeOutThx is the fastest way to log you out of websites. Get it here or get it [from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/logmeoutthx/gicflflddlmpbepckahdlibiinnhhoml).

The most recent version is the Chrome extension but you can get a bookmarklet version from [logmeoutthx.com](http://logmeoutthx.com).

The script looks for elements in the page that look like "Sign off", "Log out", etc. and dispatches a click event on them.
If no such element is found, well, that's too bad.
